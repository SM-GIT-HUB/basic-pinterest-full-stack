High-Level Design (HLD) for Pinterest Clone
1. Architecture Overview
Client Side: User interacts through a web browser.
Server Side: Node.js with Express framework, using MongoDB as the database.
Authentication: Passport.js for handling user authentication.
File Storage: Multer for handling file uploads (images).
Views: EJS templates for rendering dynamic content.
2. Components
Client-Side (Frontend)

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Provides the user interface.
EJS Templates: Render dynamic content based on server-side data.
index.ejs - Registration page
login.ejs - Login page
profile.ejs - User profile page
feed.ejs - Feed displaying posts
add.ejs - Form for adding new posts
error.ejs - Error page
Server-Side (Backend)

Express.js: Framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
Routes:
/ - Home page (index)
/login - Login page
/register - Registration page
/profile - User profile page
/add - Form for adding new posts
/feed - Feed page displaying all posts
/logout - Logout route
/fileupload - Route for uploading user profile picture
/createpost - Route for creating new posts
Passport.js: Authentication middleware.
Uses passport-local strategy for user login.
Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads (images).
Database

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and post data.
Mongoose: ODM library to interact with MongoDB.
Schemas:
user - Defines user attributes (username, password, posts, etc.)
post - Defines post attributes (title, user, description, image)
File Storage

Local Storage: Images are stored locally in the public/images/uploads directory.
3. Data Flow
Registration and Login

Users submit registration or login forms.
Data is sent to server-side routes (/register or /login).
Passport.js handles authentication.
On successful authentication, users are redirected to their profile page.
Profile Management

Users can upload a profile picture and create new posts.
Profile updates and post creations are handled by routes (/fileupload and /createpost).
Feed Display

The /feed route fetches all posts from the database and renders them using the feed.ejs template.
Error Handling

Errors are captured and displayed using the error.ejs template.
4. Security
Authentication: Managed with Passport.js and stored in session.
Data Validation: Basic validation for user input (e.g., email format).
Error Handling: Basic error handling with friendly messages for known errors.
